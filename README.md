# Flight Price Detection EDA

This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on flight price data to uncover insights and trends that influence ticket pricing. The analysis begins with data cleaning, which involves identifying and handling missing values, converting date and time formats, and removing unnecessary columns to streamline the dataset.

Key features such as airline, source, destination, and flight duration are examined to understand their impact on flight prices. The project employs feature engineering techniques to create new variables from existing data, enhancing the dataset's predictive power. For instance, the date of the journey is split into day, month, and year, while departure and arrival times are transformed into separate hour and minute components.

Categorical variables, including airline and source/destination cities, are converted into numerical formats using One-Hot Encoding, making them suitable for machine learning algorithms. The ultimate goal is to provide a comprehensive understanding of the factors influencing flight prices, enabling better decision-making for travelers and airlines alike.

## Key Points
- **Data Cleaning**: Addressing missing values and formatting issues.
- **Feature Engineering**: Creating new variables to improve analysis.
- **Categorical Transformation**: Converting categorical data into numerical formats.
- **Insights Generation**: Identifying trends and patterns in flight pricing.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Laying the groundwork for future machine learning applications.

This project serves as a foundational step towards developing predictive models that can forecast flight prices based on various influencing factors.
